# math-series

**Author**: Chris Ball
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This program will return the nth number in a specified sequence. There is a function for the Fibonacci Sequence, a function for the Lucas Sequence, and a function that allows you to create your own sequence. All three functions will add the first number to the second number to create the third number, then they will add the third to the second to create the fourth, and so on. The fibonacci function will using starting numbers 0 and 1. The lucas function will use the starting numbers 2 and 1. The sum_series will use the starting numbers you specify: the second argument is the first number and the third argument is the second number. For all three functions, the first (or only in the case of fibonacci and lucas) argument is the nth number of the sequence that you want returned to you.

## Getting Started
To use these functions, you will call them with an argument 'n', which represents the nth number in the sequence you want returned to you. For the sum_series function, you have optional second and third arguments to customize the sequence. If you do not use them, the default will be 0 and 1, respectively, resulting in the Fibonacci Sequence. If you choose to create a custom sequence, the second argument will be the first number in the sequence and the third argument will be second number in the sequence.
